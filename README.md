# NSDC-Business-Intelligence-Track
Predicting sales data for cars (intro-level) and *possibly* houses (more advanced). This track will be data-viz intensive with some optional ML.
**Project Overview:**
Explore what factors influence car sale prices using a clean, beginner-friendly dataset. The project is visualization-first, with optional linear regression to quantify relationships.

Car sales data including numerical features (e.g. mileage, engine size, year) and categorical features (e.g. car type, fuel type, transmission). Well-suited for Excel and Tableau dashboards.
